# Conv-LSTM EEG Classifier
Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide means for communication and for controlling computer-based applications using only brain signals. 
A subtype of such systems, the Eye-Brain-Computer Interfaces (EBCIs), applies the BCI technology to distinguish between spontaneous eye 
movements and eye movements intentionally used for control.
This project is dedicated to ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals classification problem in EBCI.
